# Genome assembly of  _Ranitomeya imitator_ and gene expression of Mullerian mimics

Adam tries to assembly a poison frog genome. There is much weeping and gnashing of teeth. 

There are two subdirectories in this GitHub repository. The first contains [details and scripts related to genome assembly](https://github.com/AdamStuckert/Ranitomeya_imitator_genome/tree/master/GenomeAssembly). The second contains [details and scripts for our gene expression analyses](https://github.com/AdamStuckert/Ranitomeya_imitator_genome/tree/master/GeneExpression). *Please note that in the code laid out here we utilize an approach that uses a fasta file with annotation in gff3 format for the gene expression analyses contained in this subdirectory. If you are downloading the genome assembly from ENA/NCBI to use for gene expression analyses the assembly will 1) have a different name and 2) be in the EMBL flat format with no separate gff3 file containing annotation data. This difference occurs because the ENA requires genome assemblies to be submitted in EMBL format. Thus, anyone using the code laid out in the gene expression workbook will need to modify the STAR code appropriately.*

All relevant data can be found in the European Nucleotide Archive under accession number [PRJEB28312](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/browser/view/PRJEB28312).
