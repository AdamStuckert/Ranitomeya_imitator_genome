# Genome assembly of  _Ranitomeya imitator_ and gene expression of Mullerian mimics

Adam tries to assembly a poison frog genome. There is much weeping and gnashing of teeth. 

There are two subdirectories in this GitHub repository. The first contains [details and scripts related to genome assembly](https://github.com/AdamStuckert/Ranitomeya_imitator_genome/tree/master/GenomeAssembly). The second contains [details and scripts for our gene expression analyses](https://github.com/AdamStuckert/Ranitomeya_imitator_genome/tree/master/GeneExpression). 

All relevant data can be found in the European Nucleotide Archive under accession number [PRJEB28312](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/browser/view/PRJEB28312).
