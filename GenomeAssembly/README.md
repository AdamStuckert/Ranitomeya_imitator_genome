### Genome assembly

Details of our experimental approach to assembling and improving the *Ranitomeya imitator* genome can be found in the [Workbook](https://github.com/AdamStuckert/Ranitomeya_imitator_genome/blob/master/GenomeAssembly/GenomeAssemblyWorkbook.md). This is a fairly exhaustive document which we feel adequately recapitulates our approaches.
